      <p>Hi</p>

      <h2> My Skills</h2>
      <h3>Mechanical Product Design</h3>
      <p>
        I've spent my career designing mechanical components that are fit for purpose, 
        simple to manufacture, and robust to change.  I have extensive experience with GD&T, 
        tolerance stackups, CAD, drafting, and design automation.
      </p>
      <h3>Product Development</h3>
      <p>
        Using my experience in product design, I can identify shortcomings in design 
        principles and design experiments and other knowledge gathering activities to 
        bridge the gap between first principles and application.
      </p>
      <h3>Design Automation</h3>
      <p>
        I facilitate design automation by reducing organic work practices to clear and 
        concise algorithms for robust decision making and calculation.
      </p>
      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>
        My programming experience in Python and Visual Basic for Applications allow me to 
        develop practical tools to facilitate my work as well as the jobs of others.  
        I also enjoy participating in <a href='https://adventofcode.com'>Advent of Code</a>.
